The goal of `covid19vaccinationch` is to provide a dashboard article analyzing the weekly Vaccination report from [**BAG**](https://www.bag.admin.ch/bag/en/home.html) (Bundesamt f√ºr Gesundheit - Swiss Federal Office for Public Health) collecting the data from the past 4 weeks..

"Vaccinated" are split into 3 categories:   
- *Fully Vaccinated with Booster*   
- *Fully Vaccinated without Booster*   
- *Partially Vaccinated*.

The categories above are compared with the "Unvaccinated".

Hospitalized and Deaths rates withing the 4 populations are compared to derive who is more at risk.
The following measures are shown in the article:   
- Hospitalized / Deaths counts   
- Hospitalized / Deaths per 100'000 people   

Entries with "Unknown" vaccination status are allocated to the 4 populations proportionally.
Infection cases cannot be used for comparison because not provided by BAG.

The application fetches the data from BAG any time it is run. Given that BAG updates the data daily also for the past weeks (delay in communication) the presented results are also updated.
A new week is published by BAG on Monday.

It is expected that upon data structure changes from BAG this application may fail to initialize. An update will be then provided within short time.

# ShinyApps.io deployment

The article is being deployed to **Shinyapps.io** as an **Rmarkdown** Rmd document.

`Index.Rmd` file contains the article text and the R code that reads and processes the data. 
Instead of deploying to Shinyapps.io the `app.R` file, it is possible to deploy an Index.Rmd file that will generate `index.html` once rendered. 
The Rmd article is written with `runtime: shiny` and contains both `ggplot2` / `plotly` graphs and `shiny` dynamic charts.
